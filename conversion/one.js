Here, we use times * for a number and a string. There's no operation with strings that involves multiplication, so here, the ideal coercion is from string to number (as numbers have compatible operations with multiplication).

But since a string (in this case, "hello") is converted to a number (which is NaN) and that number is multiplied by 35, the final result is NaN.
